# What A Deal!

*A currency mod aiming to fit in with the infinite nature of Minecraft.*

## Dealing with the elephant in the room...

Minecraft is an infinite game. Infinite items, infinite world generation. This poses a problem to traditional supply/demand market models, as eventually, a server's currency would simply get hyperinflated with the constant influx of new items, and declining demand.

We intend to remedy this problem by basing the value of a given currency off of the amount of materials converted, decreasing the amount of conversion points gained as more of an item is converted. This logarithmic decrease of conversion points allocated per material inputted scales well with the infinite nature of Minecraft. Requiring your endgame farms to be as efficient as ever in order to keep up your income streams as you reach the conversion rate plateau.
